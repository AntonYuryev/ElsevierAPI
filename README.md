# Python SDK to access all Elsevier knowledgebases and software: Resnet, Reaxys, Embase, Pharmapendium and more
This repository was built to combine data from several Elsevier knowledgebases.  Most recent ResnetAPI code will be uploaded here into ResnetAPI folder.<br/><br/>
Resnet is the biggest molecular biology knowledge graph in the world. ResnetAPI uses Python *Zeep* package for accessing via SOAP API the knowledge graph stored in Pathway Studio relational database. It then transforms fetched data into graph representation by Python *Networkx* package. User must create a request to the relational database using _**Graph Object Query language (GOQL)**_. This can be accomplished using *PathwayStudioGOQL.py* module or simply by passing a GOQL request string to *APISession.load_graph_from_oql(...)* function. GOQL documentation is vailable from https://github.com/AntonYuryev/ElsevierAPI/tree/main/ElsevierAPI/ResnetAPI/Documentation<br/>_**APISession**_ class can iterate data retrival for optimal network performance and should be used for most GOQL request. The GOQL query result is loaded into *APISession.Graph*_**: ResnetGraph**_ object derived from _**Networkx.MultiDiGraph**_. Properties for relations and entities that should be loaded into *APISession.Graph* can be specified by adding their database names into *APISession.relProps* and *APISession.entProps*. By default **relProps=['Name', 'RelationNumberOfReferences'], entProps=['Name']**. Names of properties and object types are listed in https://github.com/AntonYuryev/ElsevierAPI/tree/main/ElsevierAPI/ResnetAPI/Documentation<br/>
To start using ResnetAPI library you need to obtain account on Pathway Studio server from https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/professional-services.<br/>
To start using Reaxys API please contact https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/reaxys/contact-sales<br/>
To start using Embase and Pharmapendium API please contact https://dev.elsevier.com.  API swaggers for PharmaPendium and Embase APIs are available from https://dev.elsevier.com/interactive.html.<br/>
To start using Elsevier text-mining API please contact https://demo.elseviertextmining.com<br/>
Requires installation of following Python packages: *zeep, networkx, requests, pandas, numpy, ElementTree, argparse, minidom*<br/>
