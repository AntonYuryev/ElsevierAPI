# Python SDK to access all Elsevier knowledgebases and software: Resnet, Reaxys, Embase, Pharmapendium and more
This repository was built to generate datasets combining data from several Elsevier knowledgebases.  Most recent ResnetAPI code will be uploaded here into ResnetAPI folder.<br/><br/>
Resnet is the biggest molecular biology knowledge graph in the world. ResnetAPI uses Python *Zeep* package for accessing knowledge graph stored in Pathway Studio relational database via SOAP API. It then transforms fetched data into graph representation by Python *Networkx* package. User must create a request to the relational database using _**Graph Object Query language (GOQL)**_. This can be accomplished using Python *PathwayStudioGOQL.py* module or simply by passing a GOQL request string to *APISession.APISession.LoadGraphFromOQL(...)* or to *ZeepToNetworkx.PSNetworx.LoadGraphFromOQL(...)* functions. _**ResnetAPISession.APISession**_ class must be used if GOQL query is anticipated to reteive large amount of data from knowledge graph (>1000 relations). The result of GOQL query is loaded into *APISession.Graph* or *PSNetworx.Graph* object as _**Networkx.MultiDiGraph**_. User can specify properties for relations and entities that should be loaded into Networkx.MultiDiGraph by adding them into *APISession.relProps* and *APISession.entProps*. By default **relProps=['Name', 'RelationNumberOfReferences'], entProps=['Name']**.<br/>
