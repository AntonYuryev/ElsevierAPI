# ElsevierAPI cotains Python SDK library to access all Elsevier knowledgebases: Resnet, Reaxys, Embase, Pharmapendium and more. The repository was built out of the need to write scripts creating datasets that combine data from multiple knowledgebases.  Most recent Resnet API code will be uploaded here into ResnetAPI folder.
